## Problem 1

A pharmaceutical manufacturer wants to investigate the bioactivity of a new drug. A completely randomized single-factor experiment was conducted with three dosage levels, and the following results were obtained.

**Complete the ANOVA table:**

```{r}
nt <- 3 * 4
a <- 3
df_tr <- ( a - 1 )
df_tr
df_e <- nt - a
df_e
SStr <- 450.7
SST <- 783.9
SSe <- SST - SStr
SSe
MStr <- SStr / df_tr
MStr
MSe <- SSe / df_e
MSe
F_v <- MStr / MSe
F_v 
P_v <- pf(F_v, df_tr, df_e, lower.tail = F)
P_v
```

|   | df | SS | MS | F-Value | P-Value |
|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|
| **Bet\_ Dossage** | [`r round(df_tr, 2)`]{.underline} | 450.7 | [`r round(MStr, 2)`]{.underline} | [`r round(F_v, 2)`]{.underline} | [`r round(P_v, 3)`]{.underline} |
| **Error** | [`r round(df_e, 2)`]{.underline} | [`r round(SSe, 2)`]{.underline} | [`r round(MSe, 2)`]{.underline} |  |  |
| **Total** | [`r round(df_tr + df_e, 2)`]{.underline} | 783.9 |  |  |  |

### a.

Is there evidence to indicate that dosage level affects bioactivity?

**R/**\
Assuming an $\alpha = 0.05$, There is strong evidence to conclude that the at least one of the mean bioactivities is different from the others (P-value \< $\alpha$).

### b.

Compute a 95 percent interval estimate of the mean of dosage level is 30g.

**R/**

```{r}
dos20 <- c(24, 25, 37, 30)
dos30 <- c(37, 44, 31, 35)
dos40 <- c(42, 47, 52, 38)
x2 <- mean(dos30)
x2
s2 <- sd(dos30)
s2
n2 <- 4
n2
t2_star <- qt(.975, n2-1)
t2_star
SE2 <- s2 / sqrt(n2)
SE2
Upper <- x2 + t2_star * SE2
Upper
Lower<- x2 - t2_star * SE2
Lower
```

We are 95% confident that the true mean bioactivity of the new drug at a dosage of 30 mg is between (`r round(Lower, 2)`, `r round(Upper, 2)`).

### c.

Compute a 99 percent interval estimate of the mean difference between dosages levels 20g and 40g.

**R/**

```{r}
x1 <- mean(dos20)
x1
x3 <- mean(dos40)
x3
s1 <- sd(dos20)
s1
s2 <- sd(dos40)
s2
n1 = n3 = 4
PEs <- x3 - x1
PEs
df <- n1+n3-2
df
SE <- sqrt(MSe / n1 + MSe / n3)
SE
t_star <- qt(0.995, df, lower.tail = T)
t_star
Upper1 <- PEs + (SE * t_star)
Upper1
Lower1 <- PEs - (SE * t_star)
Lower1
```

We are 99% confident that the bioactivity of the new drug at a dosage of 40 mg is between `r round(Upper1, 2)` higher, and `r round(Lower1, 2)`) lower than the dosage of 20 mg.

### d.

Compute simultaneous 95% CIs for the difference in means for dosage levels 20g and 40g, based on Tukey’s, Bonferroni’s and Scheffe’s Methods:

**R/**

```{r}
#Tukey's HSD
Q <- qtukey(0.95, 3, 12-3)/sqrt(2)
Q
Up_Tu <- PEs + Q * SE
Up_Tu
Lo_Tu <- PEs - Q * SE
Lo_Tu
# Bonferroni
g = 3 * (3 - 1)/2
dfe = 12 - 3
t_bf = qt(1 - (0.05/(2*g)), dfe)
t_bf
Up_bf <- PEs + t_bf * SE
Up_bf
Lo_bf <- PEs - t_bf * SE
Lo_bf
# Scheffe
Sh <- sqrt((3 - 1) * qf(0.95, 3-1, dfe))
Sh
Up_sh <- PEs + Sh * SE
Up_sh
Lo_sh <- PEs - Sh * SE
Lo_sh
```

Tukey's HSD 95% confidence interval = (`r round(Lo_Tu, 2)`, `r round(Up_Tu, 2)`)\
Bonferroni's 95% confidence interval = (`r round(Lo_bf, 2)`, `r round(Up_bf, 2)`)\
Scheffe's 95% confidence interval = (`r round(Lo_sh, 2)`, `r round(Up_sh, 2)`)

### e.

Use Tukey’s HSD to compare pairs of treatment means.

**R/**\
When $| x_a - x_b | > Tukey's\  HSD$ we can conclude that there is a difference mean of $a$ is different of the mean of $b$

```{r}
# Tukey's HSD for all the comparisons
T_HSD <- Q * SE
T_HSD
abs(x1 - x2) > T_HSD #Comparison for dosage 20g to dosage 30g
abs(x1 - x3) > T_HSD #Comparison for dosage 20g to dosage 40g
abs(x2 - x3) > T_HSD #Comparison for dosage 30g to dosage 40g
```

For these comparisons, the only comparison in which the mean bioactivity of the new drug is significantly different, is when it is compared 20g and 40 g of dosage.

## Problem 2

The tensile strength of Portland cement is being studied. Four different mixing techniques can be used economically. A completely randomized experiment was conducted, and the following data were collected.

![](images/clipboard-3547813352.png){width="624"}

You are given the following information:

$\bar{Y}_{1.} = 2971.00$, $s(\bar{Y}_{1.}) = 56.65$ and, $MSE = 12825.7$\
$\bar{Y}_{2.} = 2933.75$, $s(\bar{Y}_{2.}) = 56.65$\
$\bar{Y}_{3.} = 2933.75$, $s(\bar{Y}_{3.}) = 56.65$\
$\bar{Y}_{4.} = 2666.25$, $s(\bar{Y}_{4.}) = 56.65$

### a.

Test the hypothesis that mixing techniques affect the strength of the cement. Test the hypothesis: $$
H_o : \mu_1 = \mu_2 = \mu_3 = \mu_3
$$ $$
H_a  : At\:least\:one\: \mu_i \neq \mu_j \:; for \: i\neq j
$$
